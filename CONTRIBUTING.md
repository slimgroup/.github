# Contributing to SLIM repositories

We welcome third-party contributions, and we would love you to become an active contributor!

Software contributions are made via GitHub pull requests to https://github.com/slimgroup repositories. If you are planning a large contribution, we encourage you to engage with us frequently to ensure that your effort is well-directed. See below for more details.

### Reporting issues

There are several options:
* Talk to us. You can find contact information of our team members on our [SLIM website](https://slim.gatech.edu/)
* File an issue or start a discussion on the repository.

### Making changes

First of all, read of [code of conduct](https://github.com/slimgroup/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and make sure you agree with it.

The protocol to propose a patch is:
* [Recommended, but not compulsory] Talk to us about what you're trying to do. There is a great chance we can support you.
* As soon as you know what you need to do, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.
* Create a branch with a suitable name.
* Write code following the guidelines below. Commit your changes as small logical units.
* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Write tests to convince us and yourself that what you've done works as expected. Commit them.
* Run **the entire test suite**, including the new tests, to make sure that you haven't accidentally broken anything else.
* Push everything to your fork.
* Submit a Pull Request on our repository.
* Wait for us to provide feedback. This may require a few iterations.

Tip, especially for newcomers: prefer short, self-contained Pull Requests over lengthy, impenetrable, and thus difficult to review, ones.

### Coding guidelines

Some coding rules are "enforced" (and automatically checked by our Continuous Integration systems), some are "strongly recommended", others are "optional" but welcome.

* We _strongly recommend_ to document any new module, type, method, ... with [julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/).
* We _strongly recommend_ imports to be logically grouped. As an example, condider our [JOLI.jl](https://github.com/slimgroup/JOLI/blob/master/src/JOLI.jl):
* We _strongly recommend_ to follow standard Julia coding guidelines:
  - Use camel caps for struct names, e.g. ``struct FooBar``.
  - Method names must start with a small letter; use underscores to separate words, e.g. ``function my_meth_...``.
  - Variable names should be explicative (We prefer "long and clear" over "short but unclear").
  - Comment your code, and do not be afraid of being verbose.
* We _like_ that blank lines are used to logically split blocks of code implementing different (possibly sequential) tasks.

### Adding tutorials or examples

We always look forward to extending our [suite of tutorials and examples](https://github.com/slimgroup/SLIMTutorials) with new Jupyter Notebooks. Even something completely new, such as a new series of tutorials showing your work with our softwares, would be a great addition.
