# SLIM

default community health file for SLIM repositories

## About

You can add `CONTRIBUTING`, `SUPPORT`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE(S)`, or `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE(S)` files to a public, organization-owned .github repository, and if a given community health file doesn’t exist for a repository, the organization-wide default will be used.

While the file itself won’t appear in the file browser or Git history for each repository, it will be surfaced throughout developers’ workflows, such as when opening a new issue or when viewing the Community Profile, just as if it were committed to the repository directly.
