The Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modelling---[SLIM], is a
widely recognized world leader in the development of the next
generation of seismic acquisition and imaging technology for the oil &
gas industry. [SLIM's][SLIM] interdisciplinary research team, with
direct involvement of faculty from Computer Science and Mathematics,
has leveraged recent developments in transformative fields of
[compressive sensing] and [machine learning] ('big data') to drive
innovations in exploration seismology. Integrating broad geophysical
insights with cutting edge sampling and computational approaches has
led to major improvements (see our [mind map]) in seismic data
[acquisition], [modelling], [imaging], and [inversion]. The main
breakthrough of our approach is a new framework with acquisition and
computational costs that are no longer determined by pessimistic
sampling criteria. Instead, our costs depend on structure, e.g.,
sparsity or low rank, exhibited by the final inversion results and
these costs will therefore no longer grow uncontrollably with the
dimensionality of the inversion problem.

At the [Georgia Institute of Technology], [SLIM] will continue build on past successes and expand its research program to include the application of machine learning to problems in computational seismology. In collaboration with the Center for energy & Geo Processing [CeGP], we are in the final stages of starting the Center for Machine Learning for Seismic ([ML4Seismic]), which is aimed to bring together experts in quantitative interpretation and computational seismology. By leveraging recent developments in Machine Learning and access to the Cloud, we will drive innovations and train new talent in the exciting new area of [ML4Seismic].

At the University of British Columbia, the Oil & Gas industry supported our research program via the [SINBAD] project  adapting [SLIM's][SLIM] technology to capture more information from the complex subsurface that was previously unresolvable. Through active collaboration with industry and support, through the [DNOISE] Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ([NSERC]), [SLIM] became a major hub for training the next generation of scientists critical to the world's future resource management. [SLIM] is well connected with scientists locally and internationally through the [*I*nternational *I*nversion *I*nitiatitve]. The combination of cross disciplinary expertise and partnerships puts [SLIM] in an outstanding position to lead and address fundamental issues related to the quality and cost of seismic data acquisition, and to improve our ability to invert exceedingly large data volumes for crucial subsurface information using wave-equation based inversion techniques such as wave-equation based migration velocity analysis (WEMVA) and full-waveform inversion (FWI). The *D*ynamic *N*onlinear *O*ptimization for *I*maging in *S*eismic *E*xploration ([DNOISE II][DNOISE]) project received funding from [NSERC] in 2010, and matches the contribution from the [sponsors] of the [SINBAD] project. -->
